    "Of course, there are different sorts of dough, depending on what kind of bread you're making.\n",

    "\n",
    "You set the parameters to how you want them, and hit the 'start' button.\n",

    "You might want to leave the dough to prove for a while, perhaps shape it into a nice loaf-shape, and at some point it's going to need baking.\n",
    "All of these things are analogous to *methods* belonging to an object.\n",
